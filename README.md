To run this simplified forum system, you need to follow the following steps:
1. Save the above code as index. php, login. php, post. php, and database. php files, respectively.
2. Ensure that PHP is installed on your server. If not, please install a PHP development environment such as XAMPP or WAMP.
3. Create a MySQL database named "forum" and create the following tables in it:
-Threads: id, title, content, created_ At
-Replies: id, thread_ ID, title, content, created_ At
4. In the database.php file, modify the $host, $username, $password, and $dbname variables to match your MySQL database settings.
5. Place these four files (index. php, login. php, post. php, and database. php) in the document root directory of your web server.
6. Use a web browser to access your server address, for example http://localhost/ . You should be able to see the homepage of the forum.
7. Use the login page (e.g http://localhost/login.php ）Register a new user or log in to an existing user.
8. On the publishing page (e.g http://localhost/post.php ）Publish new topics or reply to existing ones.
Please note that this is a simplified example, and the actual forum system will have more features and security measures. This example is for reference and learning purposes only.
